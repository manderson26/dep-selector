This will likely be getting split out into its own project, as currently
it only shares dependencies on the contents of the 'examples' directory.

This project creates a standalone executeable 'solver' that interfaces with
gecode and provides a simple REPL interface.

To build, ensure you have the gecode dev libs installed, then run

./quickbuild

(Makefile coming when we split this out...)

The file 'reader.rb' parses the contents of examples in ../examples
and formats them in a way that "solver" can recognize.

Sample usage:
./reader.rb ../examples/example_1.txt | ./solver
